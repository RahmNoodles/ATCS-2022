                        I've been studying Computer Science for the past 6 years, and my earliest fascination with it even dates back to 10 years ago, with Scratch being my first exposure.

                        Throughout my time discovering Computer Science, I have learned multiple languages: Java, Python, R, CSS, and HTML, and some of the practical applications.

                        My favorite aspect of Computer Science is Game Development, with a close second going to Data Structures and Algorithms. However, what I love the most about Computer Science is its diverse catalog of material, with numerous practical applications for every type of person.
